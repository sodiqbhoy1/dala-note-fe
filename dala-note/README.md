## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   └── styles/
│       ├── App.css      # Component-specific styles
│       └── index.css    # Global styles with Tailwind import
├── App.jsx              # Main application component
└── main.jsx            # Application entry point
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <https://github.com/Dala-Note/dala-note-fe.git>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Dala-Note/dala-note-fe/dala-note
```

### 2. Set Up Development Branch

**Important: Always develop new features on the development branch, not main.**

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# If development branch doesn't exist, create it from main
git checkout -b development

# Pull latest changes from development branch
git pull origin development
```

### 3. Adding New Features

When adding a new feature, follow this workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create a new feature branch from development
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make your changes and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "Add: your feature description"

# 3. Push your feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Create a Pull Request to merge into development branch (NOT main)
# Use your Git hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to create PR from:
# feature/your-feature-name → development

# 5. After PR is approved and merged, clean up
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Strategy:**
- `main` - Production-ready code only
- `development` - Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Development Commands

**Start development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Build for production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Run linting:**
```bash
npm run lint
```

**Preview production build:**
```bash
npm run preview
```
